# AI Coding Assistant Setup

Railtracks ships with built-in support for the most popular AI coding assistants. Running one command installs a **skill**: a structured knowledge file that teaches your assistant how to build agents, use tools, and compose workflows correctly.

Without a skill, your assistant has to guess at the API. With one, it knows exactly what `rt.agent_node()`, `rt.function_node()`, and `rt.Flow` expect; and it won't make things up.

!!! tip "Using Claude Code?"
    The [Claude Code plugin](claude_code_plugin.md) is the quickest way in: two commands, and it works before Railtracks is installed.

## Installation

Make sure the CLI is installed first:

```bash
pip install 'railtracks[visual]'
```


## Always-On Rules (`AGENTS.md`)

Skills load only when the assistant decides they're relevant, and it often doesn't. For the core API, always-on context works better: in [Vercel's agent evals](https://vercel.com/blog/agents-md-outperforms-skills-in-our-agent-evals), a short `AGENTS.md` index beat on-demand skills by a wide margin. Run this from your project root:

```bash
railtracks agents-md
```

It writes a short Railtracks block (the core patterns, the right call where coding agents often guess wrong, and links to these docs) into `AGENTS.md`, creating the file if needed. The block sits between `<!-- BEGIN:railtracks-agent-rules -->` and `<!-- END:railtracks-agent-rules -->`, and re-running the command replaces only what's between the markers, so anything else you keep in `AGENTS.md` is left alone. Because Claude Code skips `AGENTS.md` when a `CLAUDE.md` exists, the command also creates `CLAUDE.md` with an `@AGENTS.md` import, or adds that line to your existing `CLAUDE.md` if it's missing.

The block records the railtracks version that wrote it; rerun `railtracks agents-md` after upgrading so it matches. To opt out, delete the block (markers included) from `AGENTS.md`, and the `@AGENTS.md` line from `CLAUDE.md` if nothing else needs it.

Skills and the block work well together: the block keeps the basics right in every session, and skills cover multi-step work like RAG pipelines and middleware.

## Supported Assistants

=== "Codex"

    Installs a repository-scoped skill at `.agents/skills/agent-builder/SKILL.md`. Codex automatically discovers skills in `.agents/skills` when working in the repository.

    ```bash
    railtracks add codex:agent-builder
    ```

    ??? success "What gets created"
        ```
        .agents/
        └── skills/
            └── agent-builder/
                └── SKILL.md   ← railtracks agent-building knowledge
        ```

=== "Claude Code"

    Installs a skill directory at `.claude/skills/agent-builder/`. Claude Code automatically picks up skills in this directory and applies them when you ask it to build an agent.

    ```bash
    railtracks add claude:agent-builder
    ```

    ??? success "What gets created"
        ```
        .claude/
        └── skills/
            └── agent-builder/
                ├── SKILL.md   ← railtracks agent-building knowledge
                └── ...        ← any supporting files the skill ships
        ```

    !!! note "Supporting files"
        A skill can ship more than `SKILL.md`; `references/`, `scripts/`, and so on. The whole
        directory is copied, with its sub-paths intact. Claude Code loads a supporting file only
        when `SKILL.md` links it, on demand, so nothing extra enters the context until it is needed.

=== "GitHub Copilot"

    Installs a skill directory at `.github/skills/agent-builder/`. Copilot auto-discovers skills in `.github/skills` and loads one on demand when its description matches what you're working on.

    ```bash
    railtracks add copilot:agent-builder
    ```

    ??? success "What gets created"
        ```
        .github/
        └── skills/
            └── agent-builder/
                ├── SKILL.md   ← railtracks agent-building knowledge
                └── ...        ← any supporting files the skill ships
        ```

    !!! note "Migrated from copilot-instructions.md"
        Older railtracks versions appended Copilot skills as a marker block inside
        `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. That path is no longer written; if you have one from a
        prior install, railtracks reports it on your next `railtracks add` and leaves it in place for
        you to remove (see [Keeping Skills in Sync](#keeping-skills-in-sync)).

=== "Cursor"

    Installs a skill directory at `.cursor/skills/agent-builder/`. Cursor discovers skills in `.cursor/skills` and loads one when its description matches the current context.

    ```bash
    railtracks add cursor:agent-builder
    ```

    ??? success "What gets created"
        ```
        .cursor/
        └── skills/
            └── agent-builder/
                ├── SKILL.md   ← railtracks agent-building knowledge
                └── ...        ← any supporting files the skill ships
        ```

    !!! note "Migrated from .cursor/rules"
        Older railtracks versions installed Cursor skills as a single `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`
        file. That path is no longer written; a `.mdc` from a prior install is reported on your next
        `railtracks add` and left in place (see [Keeping Skills in Sync](#keeping-skills-in-sync)).

### Install all skills

Use `all` instead of a skill name to install every bundled skill for an assistant:

```bash
railtracks add claude:all
railtracks add codex:all
railtracks add copilot:all
railtracks add cursor:all
```

Each skill uses the same installer and overwrite behavior as an individual install.
If a Copilot skill is already present, or you decline an overwrite for Claude Code,
Codex, or Cursor, the bulk command keeps that skill unchanged and continues with
the remaining skills. It reports installed and skipped totals at the end. Re-running
the command installs any missing skills without requiring you to replace existing ones.
To replace existing skills without prompting, append `--force`:

```bash
railtracks add claude:all --force
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--force` | Overwrite an existing skill without prompting |
| `--list` | Print every bundled skill and supported assistant, then exit |

```bash
railtracks add --force claude:agent-builder
```

## Available Skills

To see what ships with the version you have installed, ask the CLI:

```bash
railtracks add --list
```

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `agent-builder` | Build agents, tools, flows, and multi-agent workflows with railtracks |
| `rag` | Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines with loaders, chunkers, embedders, and vector stores |
| `middleware` | Add middleware to railtracks nodes and agents, including retries, logging, and guardrails |


## How It Works

Skills are bundled **inside the railtracks package**, no internet connection required. When you run `railtracks add`, the CLI:

1. Reads the bundled skill content for the requested skill
2. Formats it with the frontmatter and structure that your specific assistant expects
3. Writes it to the correct location in your project

!!! tip "Point your assistant at the docs"
    For anything a skill doesn't cover, point your assistant at [`https://docs.railtracks.org/llms.txt`](https://docs.railtracks.org/llms.txt), which links a plain Markdown copy of every docs page.

!!! tip "Commit the files"
    These files are small and stable. Committing them means every developer on your team gets the same assistant behaviour out of the box, no manual setup required.

!!! warning "Existing files"
    You'll be prompted before anything is overwritten that railtracks can't confirm it wrote itself
    and that nobody has edited since. Re-running the command over an untouched install doesn't
    prompt; there's nothing of yours to lose. Pass `--force` to skip the prompt entirely.

## Keeping Skills in Sync

Each installed skill carries a small `.railtracks.json` recording what was written, which railtracks
version wrote it, and a checksum per file. **Commit it along with the skill** — it's what makes the
next install a sync rather than a copy:

- A supporting file an older railtracks shipped and the current one dropped is **removed**, so a
  stale page can't linger and get read by your assistant.
- A file you've since edited is **never** removed. Railtracks reports it and leaves it alone.
- Re-installing an unchanged skill rewrites the manifest byte-for-byte, so it won't churn your diff.
- If the install came from a different railtracks version, you'll be told when you re-install.

!!! note "Skills installed before this feature"
    Older railtracks versions installed GitHub Copilot skills as a marker block inside
    `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and Cursor skills as `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`. Those
    predate the manifest, so railtracks can spot them but won't delete them — a `.mdc` looks
    identical to a rule you wrote yourself. You'll be told where they are; removing them is your
    call.

## Example: Building Your First Agent

Once the skill is installed, just ask your assistant:

```
Build me a railtracks agent that searches the web and summarises results
```

Your assistant will use the skill to generate correct `rt.function_node` tools, a properly configured `rt.agent_node`, and a `rt.Flow` with a runnable `__main__` block without you having to paste docs into the chat.

## Example: Building a RAG Pipeline

Install the RAG skill and ask your assistant to wire up a pipeline over your data:

```bash
railtracks add claude:rag
```

```
Build a RAG pipeline that ingests my PDF docs folder and answers questions about them
```

Your assistant will set up the correct loader, chunker, embedder, and vector store, wire them into a `RetrievalRuntime`, and expose retrieval as a tool in an agent — without you having to look up import paths or constructor signatures.
