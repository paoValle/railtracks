"""Every railtracks symbol a bundled skill mentions must actually exist.

Skills are prose shipped to an LLM: when the package renames or removes something,
nothing breaks until an agent follows a stale instruction. This check reads the
*whole* SKILL.md; not only code blocks.

Run as a plain pytest so a stale skill fails in a contributor's checkout, not only in CI.

Only *dotted* mentions are checked: `rt.X`, `railtracks.X`, `from railtracks... import X`.
Bare class names are not — see `test_bare_class_names_are_a_known_blind_spot`.
TODO: (Suggested) Fix this bahaviour by adding a no-bare-name rule for skills.
